At start-up, you can see a table with a list of file recorded. This list is generated from C:/KeyboardMousePlayer folder. For every registration you can see the description and duration in minutes and seconds.
Once you click on the play button above the table, the recording will be performed.

If the "Mostra finestra progresso" checkbox is selected, a red window will appear in the lower right corner showing the progress of the recording in progress. It is possible to block the execution of the recording using the shortcut CTRL + SHIFT
